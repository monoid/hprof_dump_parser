OpenJDK HPROF dump parsing library.

Based on https://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk/file/9a73a4e4011f/src/hotspot/share/services/heapDumper.cpp
and http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk6/jdk6/jdk/raw-file/tip/src/share/demo/jvmti/hprof/manual.html

Currently, the supported ID sizes (actually, pointer sizes) are 4 and 8.

The library provides a streaming interface (iterator over dump
records).  Class structure information is kept in memory as it is
required for unpacking object data.
